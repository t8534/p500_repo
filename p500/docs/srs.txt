Software Requirements Specification.
------------------------------------

1.
There are 2 layers of design.

There is Components layer:
Define modules, modules interfaces, data flow between modules, modules configuration.

There is Recepture layer:
Define process workflow to get expected controller functionality.
The Recepture use Components layer as an environment to realize expected workflow.
The Recepture manage set of workflows which are called Recepture itself. 

2.
Components layer contains 3 kinds of object.

Variable - represent messages conveyed between Components.
Standard Components - Cannot be controller by Recepture object.
Controlled Components - Can be controlled by Recepture object.

3.
All external harwdare as sensors, or valve servos are controlled by Data Bus.
Data Bus can be CAN, Modbus, in general should be designed as a generic bus
for exchange the data.

4.
Each Component has an interface for periodic call for processing.
There should be set an mechanism to periodically call Components with defined
priority.
